This project removes some cumbersome tasks when you are using the IAM User programmatic access method.

## Viewing Credential details

When you have multiple sets of credentials in your `~.aws/credentials` file. It can become harder to know what credentials belong to what AWS Account.
You can use a descriptive profile name, but what if you did not do that? How do you know to what AWS Account the credentials belong?

The [Retrieve credentials context](../1-user-guide/1-retrieve-credential-context) section of the [User Guide](../1-user-guide) can help you out!
